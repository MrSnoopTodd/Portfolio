Personal Data Science Projects

These projects were done in the summer of 2019 while I was studying data science at WeCloudData and updated in August 2020. My more recent work as a consultant at Beam Data is more advanced, but I am unable to share it here for confidentiality reasons. This portfolio is still a good illustration of my capabilities with Python, Tableau, and machine learning.
